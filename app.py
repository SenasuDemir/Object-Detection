The application will display the image with bounding boxes around the objects.

    ### Tips:
    - You can upload different images to see how the object detection model works.
    - Supported formats: PNG, JPG, JPEG.
    - The app uses cvlib to detect common objects in the images, such as people, cars, trucks, and more.
